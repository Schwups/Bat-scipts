# Bat-scipts
A collection of random bat scripts and tools that i have made in the past
#### includes
- runipconfig.bat - runs ipconfig and outputs the result to a text file 
- passgrab.bat - using NETSH WLAN it grabs any information about networks stored on the device and outputs to a text file, usefull to quickly get a password to a wifi network (obviously make sure you get permission from the network and/or the device owner first, or dont what do i care)
- File_Documenter.bat - outputs the name and file extention of every file within the Files_To_Be_Documented subfolder to a text file, dosent work with files in subfolders and only displays the name of the subfolder
