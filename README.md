# Bat-scipts
A collection of random bat scripts and tools that i have made in the past
#### includes
- runipconfig.bat - runs ipconfig and outputs the result to a text file 
- passgrab.bat - using NETSH WLAN it grabs any information about networks stored on the device and outputs to a text file, usefull to quickly get a password to a wifi network (obviously make sure you get permission from the network and/or the device owner first, or dont what do i care).
- File_Documenter.bat - outputs the name and file extention of every file within the Files_To_Be_Documented subfolder to a text file, dosent work with files in subfolders and only displays the name of the subfolder.
- BACKUP USB.bat - uses 7-zip's command line interface to create a .7z archive containing every file and folder located within the specified drive. Usefull if you (like me) are worried about loosing a usb stick and want to frequently make backups (can also be used to make archives of specific folders on a drive if you input the disk location instead of just a drive letter). DISCAIMER the included 7z.exe file is used under the GNU LGPL License and is property of its respective owner. 7-Zip's website can be found [HERE](https://www.7-zip.org/)
